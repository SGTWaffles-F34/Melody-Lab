//Open melody main and run to use the program in an IDE console. I recommend using eclipse IDE to run since that is what I used to write this project.

//You will be presented with a menu that shows you all available commands and a descrition of their use

//put .txt at the end of the file names when you give them o the command line. made this before I knew how to make it so the user doesnt have to worry about that.

//enjoy! :)
